# Plutocats
Plutocats is an onchain club for crypto enthusiasts. Inspired by Nouns, Plutocats
takes some of its best ideas like onchain art and iterates on others to create a
foundation for a stable community.

This initial release of Plutocats is considered functionally complete, however,
future contributions are planned to guide the community (if they choose to do so) through stages 2 and 3 listed below:

1) `Current stage`: Onchain avatar community and capital formation that earns Blast native yield. (staking w/ friends)
2) Fair distribution of governance rights to community members.
3) DAO formation and onchain governance of yield earned through membership sales.
