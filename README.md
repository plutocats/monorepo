# Plutocats
Plutocats is an onchain club for crypto enthusiasts.

This initial release of Plutocats is considered functionally complete, however,
future contributions are planned to guide the community (if they choose to do so) through stages 2 and 3 listed below:

1) `Current stage`: Onchain avatar community and capital formation that earns Blast native yield. (staking w/ friends)
2) Fair distribution of governance rights to community members.
3) DAO formation and onchain governance of yield earned through membership sales.
